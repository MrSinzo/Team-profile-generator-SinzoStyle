## What is it?
This is generic application that can build a quick and simple html page based on the users input from the CLI. 

## Why did I make this?
I needed a quick application to set up some teams and have ways for us to contact each other though email and also know whom is where inside our workplace. 

## How did I go about building this?
There was a lot of steps involved making something that seems so simple. We needed to use a large amount of vanilla javascript and Node.js. We pulled in the Inquirer package (version 8.2.4 specifically). We made a base HTML page to get an idea of what it should look like and then proceeded to break it down within a javascript file to let us use the inquirer to fill in the "blanks" with the users input. 
We also used Jest to test some basic functionallity of the program just to make sure things ran smoothly.
